        <h2>Next Phase Development Goals</h2>
        <p>To further enhance the Car Sales Dashboard, the following development goals are proposed for the next phase:</p>

        <h3>1. Transition to Azure SQL Server</h3>
        <p>Switching the data source to Azure SQL Server offers multiple benefits including enhanced reliability, performance, security, and scalability. This will also ensure seamless integration with other Azure services.</p>

        <h3>2. Optimize Data Model</h3>
        <p>Create star or snowflake schema models to optimize query performance and manage data efficiently. Use indexing and partitioning to further speed up data retrieval.</p>

        <h3>3. Implement Incremental Data Loading</h3>
        <p>Implementing incremental data loading will enhance the efficiency of data updates, reduce processing times, and support near real-time data insights.</p>

        <h3>4. Enhance Power BI Reports</h3>
        <p>Optimize the Power BI data model, use parameters and slicers to improve user interaction, and enhance the visual appeal of reports for better data comprehension.</p>

        <h3>5. Data Governance and Security</h3>
        <p>Implement data governance policies to maintain data quality and consistency. Use Azure Active Directory for authentication and access control to secure sensitive data.</p>

        <h3>6. Implement Data Pipeline and CI/CD</h3>
        <p>Create a robust data pipeline using Azure Data Factory for automated ETL processes. Implement CI/CD using Azure DevOps to automate testing and deployment, ensuring quick and reliable updates.</p>
