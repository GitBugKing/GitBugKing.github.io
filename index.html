                <div class="proj-description">
                    <p>Developed a back-end focused comprehensive B2C platform, inspired by modern online shopping experiences. 
                        The project aimed to provide a robust and scalable infrastructure for e-commerce applications, emphasizing secure and efficient data management and processing. 
                        It is implemented using SpringBoot, SpringCloudNetflix, and MyBatis-Plus, and deployed using Docker containers. 
                        The back-end management system includes seven major modules: system management, product system, promotion marketing, inventory system, order system, user system, and content management. 
                        The front-end e-commerce system includes modules such as user login, registration, product details, shopping cart, and order processing</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented Nginx as a reverse proxy to route requests from the front-end to various microservice modules in the E-commerce system. 
                            Stored front-end static resources in the Nginx server to achieve high-performance dynamic and static separation.</li>
                        <li>Utilized Netflix SMS service and Redis to prevent API abuse and handle verification code in the Registration and Login module. 
                            Resolved session cross-origin sharing using Spring Session.</li>
                        <li>Designed the data model for the shopping cart and stored cart data in Redis in the Shopping Cart module. 
                            Managed the storage of shopping items for both temporary and logged-in users.</li>
                        <li>Ensured interface idempotency by implementing Token and Redis to prevent duplicate form submissions in the Order module. Resolved distributed transaction issues using RabbitMQ. 
                            Implemented backend validation for login and registration information using JSR303, integrating it with Netflix SMS service.</li>
                        <li>Utilized Spring Session to store and retrieve user information, expanding session scope for session sharing across different modules. 
                            Cached user's shopping cart information using Redis and utilized Redis with Lua scripts to prevent duplicate order submissions. 
                            Employed Redisson, a distributed lock provided by Redis, to prevent concurrent user operations.</li>
                        <li>Implemented asynchronous locking of inventory using RabbitMQ when placing orders, along with a delayed queue for distributed transactions in the "local message table".</li>
                        <li>Used Hystrix, provided by Netflix, for service rate limiting and circuit breaking.</li>
                        <li>Employed Eureka, provided by SpringCloud, for service registration, discovery, and centralized management of configuration files.</li>

                    <p>Led the development of the CoupleEats Take-out System, a paradigm-shifting solution that modernized take-out ordering. Skillfully integrated Redis caching, MySQL replication, Nginx load balancing, and Sharding-JDBC to optimize data management, operational efficiency, and user experience. 
                        Demonstrated adeptness in seamlessly integrating technologies to enhance system performance and scalability.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented Redis caching strategically to alleviate database strain during peak user engagement. By pre-storing frequently accessed data judiciously, I substantially reduced database query loads, resulting in heightened system responsiveness and an exceptional user experience.</li>
                        <li>Engineered a meticulous MySQL master-slave replication framework, segregating write and read operations for augmented operational efficiency. This configuration not only mitigated database workload but also enhanced fault tolerance, safeguarding the system against potential database anomalies.</li>
                        <li>Devised a meticulous strategy for decoupling frontend assets onto a dedicated Nginx server while relegating backend logic to specialized backend servers. By orchestrating Nginx as a reverse proxy with adept load balancing, I harmonized user access, ensuring optimal resource allocation and unwavering high availability.</li>
                        <li>Leveraged Sharding-JDBC to enable distinct read-write segregation, thereby enhancing database throughput. The strategic elimination of contention between read and write processes resulted in superior performance and seamless user interactions.</li>
